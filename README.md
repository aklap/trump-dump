A Chrome extension that replaces text mentions and images of Donald Trump.

If you're experiencing Trump fatigue pre-November presidential election, install this extension to replace mentions and images of Trump in your browser with something that everyone finds soothing: puppies. 

Example images:

![Trump Dump Demo Image](/assets/trump-dump-example.png)

Technologies:

- JavaScript
- CSS

Images of puppies are copyright & attribution free images from pixabay.com

Bugs:

- Does not block video previews
- Does not block all images
- Sites that have a no overwrite rule may may not have text or images blocked

TODO:

- Add puppies, kittens options as a button 
- Randomize images
- Add to Chrome Web Store
- Add ability to block Hillary, Gary Johnson, & Jill Stein as alternatives.

(Try to get it done before November!)
